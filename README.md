# Coin Flip Simulation
This is a Python implementation for a program that simulates coin flips and shows the outcome of each coin flip. When the user chooses to quit the program, it shows the following stats:
1. number of heads
2. number of tails
3. total number of outcomes

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects#numbers](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
